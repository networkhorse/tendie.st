            <p>Welcome to Tendie Street. And now, a poem from one of Wall Street's Tendie Scavengers.</p>
        
            <p>
                I'm holding on,<br>
                Just like you.<br>
                Melvin is a piece of ðŸ’©.<br>
                But that doesn't stop them feeling the hit,<br>
                Their wallets are draining,<br>
                I've always been owing.<br>
                I don't give a fuck.<br>
                I'm not going.
            </p>
